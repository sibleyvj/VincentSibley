XSS or Cross-site scripting is a very real and abundant attack that is employed often by professional hackers and script kiddies to embed code and commands into Web Pages. Furthermore, we will discuss denial of service (DoS) attacks, which target the availability of our LAMP server and buffer overflow attacks which overload the capacity of a data holding area. Social engineering attacks are a common way hackers can gain access to systems or try to find information about systems being used, the type of servers being run, or any other information the attacker considers integral.  All of this is done by simply using various social  techniques against people in order to trick them into giving you information that you otherwise should not have. We’re also going to inject the website with queries, code, and commands that could affect anything from the Linux, Apache, MySQL, or PHP applications to alter and manipulate the website.  Therefore we are going to be discussing possible countermeasures and solutions to the most common forms of attack.  Finally, we will be concluding this paper with our thoughts of LAMP servers and their architecture for the best possible protection.</p></ul>
							<h2>Operating Model (Citi)</h2>
							<p>Collaborated with leads from Endpoint, Prevent and DAR to produce high level responsibilities for an Operational Model to eliminate ambiguity among the different tasks performed by the groups. Also integrated roles from the Infrastructure and Program Management divisions to incorporate them into this Operating Model. Created a RACI diagram that details the accountability associated with these tasks. These documents together were representative for all of Data Leakage Protection.</p>
							<ul><h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1alF7PJlX8MWby4_Q_XizWHr8eWqPPkXEXOW2EBWKu6o/edit?usp=sharing">The Operation of Student Organizations</a></h2><p>Through our research we sought to analyze student involvement in CCI Tech Clubs. These are student organizations that fall under the umbrella of the College of Communication and Information and are technology oriented. We also wanted to evaluate the student’s decision making process in joining these organizations. We used a survey data collection method to obtain all of our information from our 59 participants. Our research instruments were paper and online survey so we could obtain information from students who didn’t have laptops or desktop computers. Our population was the IT/ICT majors at Florida State University. We used a purposive sampling technique because we needed students specifically in the IT/ICT major. The problem that we are trying to address through these surveys is; why is there seemingly low participation in CCI Tech Clubs? Through our research we concluded that scheduling conflicts, a lack of exposure, and a lack of interest are the main barriers deterring students from these organizations. We believe that fixing these issues would help increase student attendance. </p></ul>
							<ul><h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/191Em1yMFBSGCDdBzxl0i93P7XoZN-wyULQNbFmVCzfA/edit?usp=sharing">ReAct</a></h2><p>To promote the release of the mobile app ReAct, we will implement a social media plan that includes a Facebook page, Twitter account, and a personalized landing page. In order to fund said rollout, we will create a GoFundMe campaign to request donations. We will facilitate user testing and implementation of the app at a “beta launch party.” In the event of a crisis, users need a quick, reliable way to reach each other and disseminate important information. The ReAct app uses a peer­to­peer network to expedite the process of reaching others, requiring only wi­fi and Bluetooth enabled device to communicate. With rising concerns over domestic terrorism, mass shootings, and the impending threat of natural disasters, in the event that a cellphone network isn’t readily available, an app that helps users communicate with each other during crisis situations is necessary. Our plan is to help facilitate the launch of the ReAct App through IT services and social media. We will use various social media platforms to spread awareness of the app’s utility, promote beta testing, and encourage users to donate to a GoFundMe page to support the continued development of the app. In addition, we plan to launch a website to illustrate how ReAct can be a used as an important resource to our peers. The website will offer information on the development team and help advocate for its use in the local Tallahassee area.</p></ul>
